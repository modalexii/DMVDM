      2: Pull from Google Calendar to Volatile Object 'B'
      4: Merge A with B; push each result to Google Calendar

      # Objects named as defined in Data.Processing.Flow
      For Object ('T') in A:
        T is not member of B: |
          # event has never been on the calendar
          Push to Google Calendar as Insert
        T is member of B: |
          # event is, or has been, on the calendar
          B[T] has status "cancelled": |
            # event was deleted through Google Calendar
            Take no action
          B[T] does not have status "cancelled": |
            # event is still on the calendar
            Values of T match B[T]: 
              # Nothing has changed
              Take no action
            Values of T do not match B[T]: |
              # event listing was updated in Eventful
